# Threatened-Australian-Fauna-Scenario

This repo contains a html file which is linked to a Tableau Dashboard, which I have created using data from IUCN Red List.

Users can download the data from https://www.iucnredlist.org/ after creating an account. Data is available in .csv and .pdf formats, which in turn can be wrangled according to each user's preference, the summary of each can also be accessed from https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/summary-statistics

For this dashboard I have tried to focus only on the Australian animals falling in the Threatened categories, (Critically Endangered, Endangered and Vulnerable), what the current scenario is for threatened animals in various categories over the past 20 years and also some statistics for each Australian state
